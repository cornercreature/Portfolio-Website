        description: "GROUNDING is a Providence, Rhode Island based simulation of human interaction of nature. Based off of our experiences on a walk on a trail in Blackstone Park Conservancy, we included data that both shows the beauty of being in nature, as well as the powerful effect human activity can have on nature. We hope that through this experience, you realize the weight of your presence in nature, as well as the responsibility in preserving."
